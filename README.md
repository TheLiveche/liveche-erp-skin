# Liveche-ERP-skin


## Liveche

This is a website that was created as a more user friendly interface for employees. 
This currently has does not utilise any dynamic logic.
All the webpages are static and are linked via referencing. 

The Style sheet for this website is built from scratch and does not utilise any bootstrap templates.

# Employees#

The following are listed by which pages were developed first.

Each employee has a uniques set of pages. This is why there are varying quantities of pages for different employees.
There are more features to be added as well as needing to connect to the ERP via api requests. 
There needs to be an implementation of a manual overide on each page this is currently only present in the stations page for the stations employees.

## Station Employees

Future developements that wish to be added is a confirmation button in the ingredient scan/pick up pages and the instructions pages. 
There is an idea that the instructions will be shown on timer first and then the employee can press complete. 
This is an extra precaution to ensure that the correct amount of time is spent on a task. 

### David and Meghan

These folders have similar content as they have the same layout and foundations the main difference is the instructions and tasks.
This should be further develeoped when the erp skin can connect to a database and seperate different user's access to the erp skin.

### Amy

Amy's folder has more pages as she needs access to the most information as she will require the instructions for preparation of ingredients and
the instructions to cooking the ingredients.
The carousel of images that is currently implemented is done by a timer. 
There is the option to got back and forth available, an future development could be to list which instructional step is currently shown.
However, the final rendition should utilise the lead times from the ERP and time the instructions accordingly.
